# hello-world
learning Github. Should have done this a long time ago.

KOD here, that's how people refer to me. Not sounded out like a word but each letter pronounced independently. I'm wicked smaht which means I'm from Boston. Looking forward to learn to code. Probably going to start with javascript.
